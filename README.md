## üíª Usage

To harness the power of these APIs, make HTTP requests to the specified endpoints using the appropriate methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Don't forget your authentication tokens!

Certainly! For a Spring Boot project in IntelliJ, the steps would be different. Here's the modified installation section:

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** 
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA and choose "Checkout from Version Control" > "Git".
   - Enter your Git repository URL and click "Clone."

2. **Import the project in IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Choose "File" > "Open" and select the cloned project directory.

3. **Build the project:**
   - IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect the project's build file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven).
   - Click "Build" > "Build Project" to download dependencies and build the project.

4. **Configure application properties:**
   - If your application relies on external configurations or properties, configure them in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. For example, database connection details.

5. **Run the application:**
   - Find the main class that contains the `main` method (usually annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`).
   - Right-click on the class and choose "Run" to start the Spring Boot application.

6. **Verify the application:**
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in your application). You should see the application running.

7. **Explore APIs:**
   - Use tools like Postman or Swagger UI to explore and test the available APIs.

**Note:** Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed on your system, and IntelliJ IDEA is configured to use that JDK.
