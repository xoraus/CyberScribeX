# üöÄ CyberScribeX üñãÔ∏è

Welcome to CyberScribeX! The ultimate Blogging Application API project, where creativity meets technology. üåê‚ú®

## üìñ Introduction

This project is aimed at developing a robust blogging application with a focus on efficient Posts and Comments management, user Authentication and Authorization, and Category organization. The application is built with RESTful APIs to ensure seamless integration and scalability.

## High-Level Requirements

1. **Posts Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete Posts with Pagination and Sorting Support.
2. **Comments Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete Comments for Blog Posts.
3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement Registration, Login, and Security measures.
4. **Category Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete Categories.


## Exceptions Handling and Validations

1. Handle exceptions and errors, returning proper error responses to the client.
2. Validate REST API requests and send validation error responses to the client.

## Securing REST APIs

1. Secure REST APIs using Database Authentication.
2. Implement LogIn/SignIn REST API.
3. Implement Register/SignUp REST API.
4. Use JWT (JSON Web Token) token-based Authentication to secure the REST APIs.
5. Implement Role-based security with ADMIN and USER roles.


## üíª Usage

To harness the power of these APIs, make HTTP requests to the specified endpoints using the appropriate methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Don't forget your authentication tokens!

Certainly! For a Spring Boot project in IntelliJ, the steps would be different. Here's the modified installation section:

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** 
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA and choose "Checkout from Version Control" > "Git".
   - Enter your Git repository URL and click "Clone."

2. **Import the project in IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Choose "File" > "Open" and select the cloned project directory.

3. **Build the project:**
   - IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect the project's build file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven).
   - Click "Build" > "Build Project" to download dependencies and build the project.

4. **Configure application properties:**
   - If your application relies on external configurations or properties, configure them in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. For example, database connection details.

5. **Run the application:**
   - Find the main class that contains the `main` method (usually annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`).
   - Right-click on the class and choose "Run" to start the Spring Boot application.

6. **Verify the application:**
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in your application). You should see the application running.

7. **Explore APIs:**
   - Use tools like Postman or Swagger UI to explore and test the available APIs.

**Note:** Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed on your system, and IntelliJ IDEA is configured to use that JDK.
